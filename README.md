# conslr - A Widget Based Terminal Emulator
This is a pet project of mine initially created as an abstraction layer to a game I am working on.

It is meant to be relatively extendable and easily modifiable.

![Example of conslr being used](https://github.com/syd-p/conslr/blob/master/res/widgetsexample.png)

## Installation
As there are no precompiled binaries (yet), you have to build it from source

To do so do the following
1. Pull the repo:
```
git clone https://github.com/syd-p/conslr.git
cd conslr
```
2. Change to the build directory and run build.sh 
```
cd build
./build.sh
```
3. Install:
```
cmake --install .
```
